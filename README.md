## Summary
This week, we had to incorporate GraphQL into an existing, fully functional website. To do this required refactoring the API to use GraphQL serverside; and fixing up the client side to take advantange of the updated server.

### Usage
Click on the heroku link above, or to run a local version, clone the repository then run 'npm i' from the root directory of the project. Then run 'npm run develop' to simultaneously launch the client and the server.

### Features
1. Conditionally rendered navbar, depending on login status
2. Add books to your reading list if logged in
3. Google Bookstore link, avaliable even if the user is not logged in
